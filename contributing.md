# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on docs.github.com ✨.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon  on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the [README]("README.md"). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

* [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
* [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
* [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
* [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

#### Issues
##### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose).

##### Solve an issue
Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

#### Make Changes
Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](https://github.com/Andysm21/ACL_Fogration_FE/blob/main/contributing.md#pull-request) for a review.

##### Make changes in a codespace
For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see [Working in a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/setting-up-your-environment-to-work-on-github-docs/working-on-github-docs-in-a-codespace).

##### Make changes locally
Fork the repository.
Using GitHub Desktop:

[Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Using the command line:

[Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
Install or update to Node.js v16. 

Create a working branch and start with your changes!

#### Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

#### Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

* Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
* Don't forget to [link PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) to issue if you are solving one.
* Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-for) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
* We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
* As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations) .
* If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
